            Hello! Welcome to my very first webpage. My name is Jana Haganová and I was born and raised in Slovakia, though for the past couple of years, I find myself living in Brno, Czechia. I'm a younger sibling, a girlfriend, and a happy owner of a crossbreed dog taken from a shelter, Dusty. I am a Scorpio and a Hufflepuff, with love for stories and nature, and I believe people should try to find happiness in little things.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout my life, I've visited—and even lived at—various places. I've had a rural Pennsylvania highschool experience, and had a chance to explore Tokyo for a year during my university studies. My steps (and cars, trains, ships, and airplanes, to be precise) have also taken me across some European countries, such as England, Austria, or a trip to Paris. And there's still so much left to see.
        </p>

            As for where I'm at right now with my life, well, I've always worked customer service jobs. For a while now, I've been playing with the idea of changing that. And here we are, at this website. You're a witness to my first step on this journey. Thank you.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you want to know more about me, take a look at the sections <i>"Curriculum Vitae"</i> and <i>"Hobbies"</i>. If you'd prefer a peaceful moment of looking at a random bunch of photos, please head on onwards to the <i>"Gallery"</i>! I hope you'll have a nice time here.
