            <p>
                <strong>Video Games.</strong> I highly enjoy exploration, building, and stories in games. I am especially fond of games that offer player choices. Games are also a great way to spend time with people, and if given the option, I always opt for a co-op game rather than something competitive.

            <p>
                <strong>Reading.</strong> I absolutely love stories. This makes me drawn to books like a moth to a flame. I prefer Young Adult books, especially fantasy and romance genre. My current favourite series are the Raven Boys series, and the Six of Crows duology.

                <strong>Party Games and Board Games.</strong> Great way to spend time with family and friends, whether one wants to relax, be challenged, or just be completely silly and have a laugh.

            <p>
                <strong>Writing and Drawing.</strong> I write stories, RP, poems/lyrics, and sometimes I sketch characters. Personally, I think it's fun to explore characters, their journeys and experience, their emotions and their growth, while being at the epicentre of it.

        <div>

            <img src="images/hobbyphoto/travel.jpg" alt="mini shrine" class="leftsidepic">

            <p>
                <strong>Travel.</strong> It is enriching to travel and see new places. My favourite trips are to nature. I like to be surrounded by the greenery and the quiet; I love hills and mountains; I find it absolutely wonderful to feel the enormity of the world around me, detached from the everyday hustle and bustle.

            <p>
                <strong>Photography.</strong> I like taking photos, capturing a moment into something lasting. I try to make photos from various trips look nice. I also try to take photos that matter to me—snapshot memories to look back on to.

            <p>
                <strong>Hangouts.</strong> Taking time out of the day to put the screen away and simply <i>be</i> with people can be so precious. I like evening talks out in a pub, winding-down with shisha in hand, or using the time together to interact beyond a conversation—billiards, badminton, laser games.
